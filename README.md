# Name and Type of Project
Our group decided to make a web application called "Grouper"

# Purpose of Project
The purpose of the project is to allow people to form a team/network with other people based on similar personalities, characteristics, and experiences in life. Many people in society find it difficult to have social interactions with others due to many barriers such as location or compatability. Grouper will defiently allow the user to find someone that matches their likes and interests which in turn, will create those connections that every human being needs.

# Inspirations
The inspiration we got from making this project was contributed to the group formation from Hackthe6ix. As this event was for the most part online, it was difficult for many individuals to find a team that met their hackathon team expectations. There are many hackers who are beginners and wanted people with around the same expereience as them. There were others who participated in many hackathons and wanted group memebers with plenty of expeience. With Grouper, the team formation problem would not exist, as the individual could filter what they prioritize in an ideal teammate and create their dream team to win Hackthe6ix.
