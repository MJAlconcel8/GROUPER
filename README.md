# Name and Type of Project
Our group decided to make a web application called "Grouper."

# Purpose of Project
The purpose of the project is to allow people to form a team and network with other people based on similar personalities, characteristics, and experiences in life. Many people in society find it difficult to have social interactions with others due to many barriers such as location or compatibility. Grouper will definitely allow the user to find someone that matches their likes and interests which in turn, will create those connections that every human being needs.

# How Project Was Built? 
Languages: Html, CSS, and Javascript

Environment: Node.js

Frameworks: Bootstrap, React

Back-end Service: Firebase(Authentication, database)

# How Does it Work?
Thw user will be greeted with the a landing page that sucessfully adverties Grouper. The user can then click a get started button to register their account via Google. After registration is complete, the user is welcomed with an empty dashboard. In the top right corner, the user is able to join many different events. Once an event is added, it will appear in the user's dashboard. When the user clicks on their added event, it will lead them into a page, where it has an announcement tab to keep them update on the event, a button to find a group or in Grouper terminology "Groupe", and a tab that shows what "Groupes" they are in. User's can form their "Groupe", by swiping right as a match or left as not a match. The user can see whether they mesh with the person, as their is a breif description of what the person is like. If the user found a match, they can talk to the person, to make further decided if they want to be in a "Groupe." The user can also create an event as an adminstrator. As adminstrator, the user can name the event, set a duration for the event, colour background, and their is a feature that auto groups people together. There is also a setting page that allows the user to update their personal information such as name, last name, username, password, and notification settings.      


# Inspirations
The inspiration we got from making this project was contributed to the group formation from Hackthe6ix. As this event was for the most part online, it was difficult for many individuals to find a team that met their hackathon team expectations. There are many hackers who are beginners and wanted people with around the same experience as them. There were others who participated in many hackathons and wanted group members with plenty of experience. With Grouper, the team formation problem would not exist, as the individual could filter what they prioritize in an ideal teammate and create their dream team to win Hackthe6ix.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
